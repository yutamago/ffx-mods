///         FFX.exe's own accumulator (<c>Sg_FrameSync</c>, <c>0x00821e80</c>) never runs 0 ticks: with fewer than
///         2 due at 60 Hz it runs 1 and drops its carries, so a frame drawn faster than 1/30 s still ticks once
///         (docs/mods/fps-unlock.md, "Unity's timing model"). This one runs
///         ⌊(carry + min(dt, cap) × scale) × rate⌋ ticks, keeps the fraction, and is what the mod hands the game

///         The cap applies to the real time, before the scale, as the game's 0.3 s does: it keeps a hitch (a load,
///         a window drag) from turning into a burst of catch-up ticks, but lets a time scale of 100 run 100 times
///         as many ticks as the frame's time is worth. <c>maxTicks</c> bounds one frame's work; past it the excess is
///         dropped (the game then runs slower than asked, but stays responsive).
