///         once-per-update parts behind (docs/mods/fps-unlock.md, "(b) Fast-forward"), so the plan uses them only
///         past <c>maxLoops</c> ticks: at ×1 to ×4 at 30 fps every tick is a whole update.

///         no bound check (<c>PhyreScene_VFXSyncPath</c>, <c>0x00654cc0</c>): a 17th path overwrites the path count and
///         the next ones write over the heap. The updates before it skip their graphics, so their passes add no paths
