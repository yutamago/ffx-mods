# FPS unlock: frame timing, and what the mod does

FPS unlock (`yuta.fps-unlock`, `mods/fps-unlock`) removes the fixed 30 fps limit of the Steam HD
Remaster without speeding the game up. The game draws at the monitor's refresh rate, at a rate you
choose, or uncapped, with vsync on or off; the world keeps its 30 ticks a second, and the camera,
the characters (their bones, cloth and hair) and the map's moving objects are drawn between ticks. A time scale gives slow
motion and fast-forward (×0.05 to ×100) without drawing more frames.

It was written in ffx-atel-sharp as `yuta.frames` (`src/Ffx.Frames`, PRs #64 to #67, history there
up to `724027e`) and moved here on 2026-11-08. Its settings are [`config.md`](config.md)'s
`frames.*`; players' notes are `mods/fps-unlock/README.txt`.

**Status.** In ffx-atel-sharp the first in-game run crashed on its first frame ("Hooking: why the
first run crashed" below). The second (2026-11-07, about 200 fps) kept the game's speed, but the
effects ran too fast and slow character motions looked choppy; the effects' replay, the character
interpolation and the cloth hold answer that. In the test of 2026-11-08 the characters, their
bones, hair and cloth were smooth and sat right, hard cuts snapped them, and ×100 and the title's
water were fine, so the characters are interpolated by default. As `yuta.fps-unlock`, with its
settings in `settings.toml` and its window in the F8 window, it has not been run in the game yet.
In that test (2026-11-08) the scrolling clouds and the water of the opening campfire kept real-time
speed at ×0.1: they run on the scene's own clock, which the mod now drives with game time ("The
scene's clock" below; not yet run in the game).

## Use

- **F8** opens the mod's settings: its part of the family's F8 window (F8 closes it again). Every
  change applies at once and is written into the mod's `settings.toml` half a second later (only
  the lines that changed; the comments stay).
- **Alt+F9** switches vsync on and off. **Ctrl+F9** switches between the fast-forward scale (×10 by
  default) and ×1, **Shift+F9** the same for slow motion (×0.25), **Ctrl+Shift+F9** goes back to
  ×1, **Ctrl+PgUp** and **Ctrl+PgDn** step through ×0.05 … ×100.
- A counter in the top-right corner shows the drawn fps, the world ticks a second (about 30 at ×1),
  vsync and the time scale (`frames.overlay`). When the CPU cannot keep up with the scale, a yellow
  line shows the speed reached ("reached ×12 of ×18").
- A saved fast-forward scale starts at ×1 and ramps up to it over the first seconds in the world
  (it doubles every second: ×18 after about 4 s). A scale above ×1 is saved only once the game has
  run at it for 5 s, so one that crashes the game is never saved and cannot crash the next start.
- The window's **Live** part shows the drawn frame rate, the world's ticks a second (about 30 at
  ×1, whatever the frame rate), the measured cost of a tick and how many fit into the budget, the
  ticks dropped a second, why the scale is held at ×1, and the camera's last move and cuts (to tune
  the cut thresholds). **Advanced** has the finer settings (`frames.budget.*`, `frames.hold.*`,
  `frames.cuts.*`, the bones and cloth).
- The log is `logs/<start time>/Yuta.FfxMods.FpsUnlock.FpsUnlockModule.log` in the Fahrenheit
  folder.

## How it works

The game runs its world in ticks of 1/30 s. Each drawn frame used to run at least one tick, so
drawing faster ran the game faster. The mod changes that:

1. **The limiter.** `Game_Main`'s frame limiter waits the mod's interval instead of 2 vsyncs.
2. **The tick accumulator.** Each drawn frame adds its real time × the time scale. It runs as
   many whole ticks as fit, 0 included, and carries the rest, like Unity's `FixedUpdate`.
3. **Frames without a tick.** Redraw runs the game's update with 0 ticks and holds what would
   still move: pad scan, controls, the v-blank count, the camera, the effects, the characters'
   bones and motion events, the cloth (the hair is cloth too), field animation, fade counters, video,
   and the counters the draw steps itself (the title's water, the dream scenes' noise). The effects'
   programs step and draw in one pass, so on these frames the mod draws again what they drew at
   the last tick instead of running them. Menus, pauses, loads and movies always use Repeat,
   because their logic runs once per update.
4. **Interpolation.** After each tick the mod records the camera and screen matrices, each
   character's matrix and bone matrices, and its cloth's vertices. For each draw it gives the
   renderer the camera and the characters between the last two ticks: rotations slerped,
   positions lerped, the cloth's vertices blended and placed with the character as drawn. A jump
   bigger than the cut or warp thresholds is drawn as it is. When the camera cuts to a new shot
   (by the thresholds, or the game sets its camera at once), the characters and their cloth are
   drawn as the tick has them too, so they do not slide in from the last shot.
   The map's moving objects (field animated parts, objects the event scripts move) are placed
   between their last two ticks after the game's update of each frame ("Moving map objects between
   ticks" below).
5. **Time scale.** Above 4 ticks per frame, ticks go through the game's exec frames (up to 99 ticks
   per update) instead of whole updates, so ×100 costs 3,000 ticks a second but no extra draws.
   Only the frame's last update draws (the game skips the others' graphics), and it always runs
   exactly one tick: each tick in it would add a VFX path, and the game's path table holds 16.
6. **The time budget.** The mod measures what a tick costs and gives each frame only as many ticks
   as fit into 40 ms of update time. A scale the CPU cannot keep up with then runs as fast as it
   can at about 25 fps, instead of each frame taking longer than the last.
7. **The scene's clock.** The renderer's own animations (the shaders' `GlobalTime`, by which the
   water and the scrolling skies move, the PC's texture animations, the radial blur, light flashes
   and the character fog's fades) used the frame's real time. They now get the accumulator's game
   time: the ticks run plus the change of the part of a tick, so they follow the scale and the
   pause, stay smooth between ticks, and keep their speed at any frame rate (`frames.speed.scene_time`).

## Limits

- **Effects, the 2D layers and blob shadows move at 30 Hz.** Effects keep their
  game speed and are drawn on every frame, but each shows its last tick's shape between ticks.
  Particles the game builds facing the camera were built for the tick's camera; with the
  camera interpolated they can trail it by up to one tick. A character's round shadow stays at
  its last tick's place. Without character interpolation the cloth and hair move at 30 Hz too.
- **What the effects replay cannot cover.** The replay re-sends the effects' geometry, the order
  of their draw paths and their draw events (screen fades, buffer copies). Something an effect
  sets only while it runs keeps its last value between ticks: the point lights the map's
  particles cast (`pppFpPointLightProc`), for example, are not set again. If an effect still
  flickers or vanishes between ticks, set **Effects between ticks** to Run and report which one.
- **Hard cuts the game does not mark.** A cut is a camera that moved over 100 units or turned
  over 45° in one tick, or one a script or magic file set at once and that jumped (more than
  three times its last step). A cut made some other way, under the thresholds, is drawn as a
  quick move over one tick; at ×0.1 that is a slow slide. Lower the cut thresholds if you see one.
- **Characters drawn by other paths** (a magic file's situation pass, the effects' character
  draws) stay at 30 Hz.
- **Map surfaces animated other ways** stay at 30 Hz: the swaying morph meshes (trees, grass; their
  weights come from the field code per tick), UV offsets the field's key frame tracks set
  (`graphicSetMaterialUV`), and objects moved by anything but `graphicObjectSetTranslation`/`Rotation`.
  Map objects themselves are drawn between ticks ("Moving map objects between ticks").
- **Fast-forward costs CPU.** Every tick is simulated. ×100 is 3,000 ticks a second, which may
  be more than one core can do (in a heavy scene a tick can take 2 to 3 ms, so about ×12 to ×15).
  The game then runs slower than asked, at about 25 fps, and the overlay shows the speed reached. A
  bigger "most update time per frame" gives more speed and fewer frames.
- **Fast-forward crashed above about ×18 before 2026-11-08** (in `yuta.frames`), and a saved ×18.42 crashed every
  start-up. A frame with many ticks ran up to 25 of them in its drawing update, and each adds an
  effect pass and a VFX path: more than the game's table of 16 holds, which overwrote the heap (no
  crash dump, nothing in the log). In play the CPU falling behind got there (each frame owed more
  ticks than the last); at start-up the first world frame after the load did (its 0.3 s owe
  9 × the scale ticks). Fixed by one tick in the drawing update, the time budget and the start-up
  ramp ("Fast-forward: why ×18 crashed" below).
- **Above 4 ticks per frame**, exec frames run several ticks per update. What runs once per update
  (field animation, fades, the characters' middle step, the video) then falls behind, as with
  the game's debug fast-forward. The effects are drawn once per frame, from its last tick.
- **Audio, movies, loads and voice-synced scenes run in real time**, whatever the scale.
- **Uncapped with vsync off** keeps one CPU core busy.
- Sound and subtitles: only the sound is muted when fast. The booster also mutes the battle
  subtitles; this mod does not.
- **Some functions cannot be hooked the usual way.** Fahrenheit's hooks overwrite a function's first
  5 bytes. `updateFFX` and `TkUpdateScanControler` each have a loop that jumps back to their third
  byte, and hooking them that way crashed the game on its first frame. The mod hooks these two at
  their calls instead. Before installing anything it checks every other hooked function for such a
  jump (skipping the bytes Windows rewrites when it loads the game at another base), and each call
  site for the expected `call`. If a check fails it installs nothing and logs
  why. Once Fahrenheit has applied the hooks, the first call through each one checks its chain. A
  bad chain switches the mod to pass-through. The details are below ("Hooking: why the first run crashed").
  A function another program hooked before Fahrenheit's hooks went in (its first 5 bytes a `jmp`,
  the rest as expected: ffx-rust's harness hook on `Renderer_PresentFlip`) is not refused: MinHook
  takes that `jmp` along in its trampoline, so this mod's hook runs first, then the other program's,
  then the function (`CodeScan.PrologueMatches`, logged once).

## The research: how FFX.exe times its frames

How often FFX.exe (Steam HD Remaster) runs its scripts, what else counts in frames, and what that means
for `Wait.Seconds`, an uncapped or monitor-rate frame rate, fast-forward, and waits shorter than a
frame. Static research only: FFX.exe's code (objdump, ffx-rust's `tools/refs.py` cross-references and
`symbols/ffx.sym`) and ffx-rust's ports of the functions involved (`crates/ffx-sg/src/m5main_loop.rs`,
`crates/ffx-sg/src/state.rs` `frame_sync`, `crates/ffx-script/src/vm/bridge/run.rs`). The game was
not run for this. The engine findings are also in ffx-rust (`docs/formats/frame-timing.md`). The mod built on
this research is described in "What the mod does" below.

## Answers

1. **A script frame is one world tick, 30 a second** in the field, events and battle alike
   (below). Atel# (ffx-atel-sharp, the script compiler) builds `Wait.Seconds(s)` on this: it
   compiles to `Wait.Frames(n)` with n = s × 30 rounded to the nearest frame
   ([language.md](https://github.com/yutamago/ffx-atel-sharp/blob/main/docs/language.md#waiting-in-seconds),
   [ATL3005](https://github.com/yutamago/ffx-atel-sharp/blob/main/docs/analyzers.md#atl3005),
   [ATL3006](https://github.com/yutamago/ffx-atel-sharp/blob/main/docs/analyzers.md#atl3006)).
2. **An uncapped or monitor-rate mod doesn't need waits in seconds, and seconds wouldn't help it.**
   `Wait.Frames` is not the only thing that counts frames: motions, moves, turns, camera moves and
   eases, effects, fades and battle all step once per world tick. The scripts are one consumer of
   that tick among many. If the game draws at 60 fps or more, the logic speeds up only because the
   tick is tied to the drawn frame. Fix that, and every frame count in the game stays right, scripts
   included. Rewriting waits in seconds would leave everything else at the wrong speed. The mod has to
   keep the tick at 30 a second and draw more often than it ticks, interpolating in between
   ("(a) Decoupled drawing" below).
3. **×100 without drawing 3,000 frames a second is possible.** The game already runs several ticks
   per drawn frame: the PC booster (×2, ×4) does it, catch-up after a slow frame does it, and so
   does the PS2 debug fast-forward `Sg_SetExecFrames(n)` (up to 99 ticks per frame). The ticks still
   cost CPU, so ×100 means simulating 3,000 ticks a second. That is likely too much for one core,
   but it is unmeasured. Audio, movies, loading and voice-synced cut scenes don't speed up with the
   ticks ("(b) Fast-forward" below).
4. **No wait shorter than a frame.** A worker's script runs at most once per tick. Any native that
   polls, `WaitFrames(0)` included, ends the worker's run for that tick, and the frame count is an
   integer. A script cannot act between two ticks, because nothing in the game happens there for it
   to see. At 30 ticks a second, one frame (1/30 s) is the finest step.
5. **Unity's timing.** FFX.exe already uses a fixed step with an accumulator (`FixedUpdate`), but
   it always runs at least one tick per drawn frame, has no interpolation, and scales time only by
   1, 2 or 4. A `FixedUpdate`-like model (0 ticks per frame, any `timeScale` including slow motion,
   interpolated drawing) is a realistic Fahrenheit mod and keeps the simulation exact. Moving
   everything to `Update`/`Time.deltaTime`, or changing the tick rate (30 → 60 Hz), means rewriting
   every per-tick duration and rate in the code and in the scripts' data. That belongs in the Rust
   port, if anywhere ("Unity's timing model" below).

## The loop

| Step | Where | What |
|---|---|---|
| Frame limiter | `Game_Main` `0x0062ee50`, `Sleep` at `0x0062f3bb` | A frame (`App_Frame` `0x0062e340`) every `g_FrameVsyncs` (`0x00c30e88`) × 1/59.94 s of `Phyre_PTimerWin32_GetTime`; sleeps away the rest. No vsync wait of its own; this is the cap |
| Frame interval | `graphicSetFlipVsnc` `0x006430e0` → `PWindowWin32Base::SetFlipVSyncInterval` `0x00625090` (clamps to 1..2) | Called with 2 by `Sg_MainInit` (`0x00820865`), with 1 when the main menu opens and 2 when it closes (`TkMenuMainLoop` `0x008a9dac`, `0x008a9fe8`), 2 when the sphere grid opens and 1 when it closes (`eiAbmStart` `0x00a56002`, `eiAbmExit` `0x00a5473d`). These five are the only callers |
| Update | `FFXApplication::animate` `0x0042f520` → `updateFFX` `0x00822840` | `updateFFX` calls `Sg_MainLoop(dt)` (`0x00820ae0`) again while `g_VoiceHold` (`0x012fb808`) is not 0, each call taking one off |
| Speed-up booster | `SpdCtrl_ScaleElapsedTime` `0x006f7340` | `dt` × `g_SpdCtrlScales[level]` (`0x00c38e1c`: 1, 2, 4; F1 steps the level) where the booster is allowed; mutes the sound while on |
| Tick count | `Sg_FrameSync(dt)` `0x00821e80` | `dt` capped at 0.3 s (`0x00b3eb44`). Ticks due = (carry + `dt`) × 60. Fewer than 2 due, or `Sg_CanSpeedUp` (`0x0081fd30`) 0: `g_VoiceHold` = 1, carries cleared. Otherwise `g_VoiceHold` = whole part of (carry + `dt`) × 30, and the fraction carries over. A voice-synced cut scene (`g_SyncOn`) counts from the sync clock instead (below) |
| World tick | `Sg_MainLoop`'s update loop (port: `m5main_loop.rs` `update`) | `Sg_GetCurExecFrames()` (`0x0082d7e0`: `0x00c496d4`, 1 by default) times: `Sg_ControlPlayer`, `MsBattleProcess`, `TkUpdateEventJump` (the scripts, below), `TOControlMessageWindow`, effects, `MsCameraProcess`, field, `Ch_CalcMain` (characters, motions). Then once per `Sg_MainLoop`: `Ch_CalcMiddle`, the field animation, the draw |
| Draw | `Sg_MainLoop`'s draw, then Phyre's frame | Each `Sg_MainLoop`, repeats included, builds its draw. Phyre queues one flip per `App_Frame` (`PRenderer_flip` `0x005b6af0`), which the render thread (`0x00616010`) presents one update behind the main thread (ffx-rust `docs/harness.md`, "Frames and threads") |

At the 30 fps interval (2 vsyncs, `dt` = 1/29.97 s), each frame has (carry + `dt`) × 60 = 2.002 ticks
due, and the hold is ⌊1.001⌋ = 1. The 0.001 left over adds up to a second tick in about one frame in
1,000 (ffx-rust `docs/harness.md` sees this as `g_VoiceHold` 2), so the world runs at 30.0 ticks a
real second, a little more than the 29.97 frames drawn. With `Sg_CanSpeedUp` 0 the carries are
dropped and it is exactly one tick per frame: 29.97 a second. When a frame is late, the next one
catches up with more ticks, at most ⌊0.3 × 30⌋ = 9.

At the 60 fps interval (main menu), only 1 tick is due per frame, so the hold is 1 and there is one
`Sg_MainLoop` per frame: 60 a second. But the main menu stops the world update: `Sg_MainLoop` takes
the menu path (`Sg_MainCheckMenu` `0x00820750`) and goes straight to the frame's end. Scripts, motions and the field
do not tick behind the menu. The same holds for the pause, the save screen and scene loads (`stop`).
So **scripts tick only in the 30 fps modes**, at 30 a second.

## What a script frame is

`TkUpdateEventJump` (`0x0088d3d0`) runs once per world tick ("every frame in `Sg_MainLoop`'s loop",
ffx.sym). Through `Atel_EventFrame` and the ctrl work's callback `AtelExecCtrlEvent` (`0x00867740`),
it runs three passes of `Atel_RunCtrlWorkers` (`0x00867950`). The first pass runs `Script_Run`
(`0x008641e0`) on every worker. The other two run only workers with a level that a request just
started (`+0x36` bits `0x180`), so a new request begins in the same tick. Every caller of `Script_Run`
is in these passes, or is the debugger (`AtelDecodeCommand`, `Atel_CtrlStart`,
`AtelExecCtrlEventInit`).

A native that polls ends the worker's run for that tick: opcode `35`/`58` (`run.rs`) starts the
native and polls it once, and a poll without the "run on" bit (4) leaves the run with an empty
stack. `Native_WaitFrames_0000` (`0x0085c4e0`) stores n, and its poll (`0x0085c6b0`) subtracts 1
and is done at 0 or below. So `WaitFrames(n)` started in tick t ends in tick t + n − 1, and the
next statement runs in tick t + n. `WaitFrames(1)` and `WaitFrames(0)` both resume in the next tick.

Two exceptions:

- **Movies with a camera.** `Native_b00a_MovieStartPicture` sets `g_WaitFramesByTime`
  (`0x0112a008`), and `destroyMoviePicture` clears it. While it is set and `movie_have_camera`
  (`0x0076efc0`: movies `0x20`, `0x2e`, `0x46`, `0x48`) holds, the poll subtracts
  `graphicVideoGetElapsedFrame()` (`0x00645d90`: the movie's frames since the last update) instead
  of 1. The wait then counts the movie's own frames, 29.97 a second (ffx-rust
  `docs/formats/platform.md`, "Movies"). `Atel_MoveUpdate` (`0x00868990`) does the same for moves.
- **The timing patch.** `WaitFrames(10)` in battle scene `0x610000` while magic `0x290` is loaded
  waits 40 frames (the start slot's one-off patch, ffx-atel-sharp's [`data/natives.json`](https://github.com/yutamago/ffx-atel-sharp/blob/main/data/natives.json)). `Wait.Seconds(1/3f)` is
  `WaitFrames(10)` and is patched the same way.

`Script_Run` also has a per-worker speed: `+0x94` × `g_GameSpeed` (`0x01326bd8`), added to
`+0x98` (`0x0086426b`..`0x008642cc`). Below 1 the worker's run stops at once. At 1 or more it runs
normally. Nothing makes it run more than once per tick. `g_GameSpeed` is 1.0 (`AtelInitTotal`), and
its only setter (`0x00871020`) has no callers. This is not a rate control.

## Frames and real time

| Counts world ticks (speeds up with them) | Counts real time or its own clock |
|---|---|
| `WaitFrames`, the poll natives (motion, move, turn, camera, message waits) | Movies: `updateTexture` takes one decoded frame per update (or per render command for `0x20`, `0x2e`, `0x48` and loops). The sound is an FMOD stream in real time, with no A/V clock (ffx-rust `docs/formats/platform.md`) |
| Motions (`SG_UpdateMotion`, in `Ch_CalcMain`), moves and turns (`Atel_MoveUpdate`), `Sg_AnimValF` eases | FMOD: music, voices and sounds mix on FMOD's threads in real time. A sound starts in a tick but plays at its own rate |
| The camera (`MsCameraProcess`), the effects' update half (`MsEffectProcess(0)`), the field (`Yn_FieldProc_0091a8c0`) | Voice-synced cut scenes: with `g_SyncOn` (`0x012fb8a0`, set by `Sg_SyncCutScene` `0x00821d60` from `iSyncGetData`, the remaster's `SyncData` tables), `Sg_FrameSync` steps ticks while the sync clock (`graphicGetTimeInMicroseconds`) is behind and spins while it is 0.1 s or more ahead, so the scene keeps pace with the voices in real time |
| Battle (`MsBattleProcess`): turn order, counters, the battle's waits | Loading: the asset loader thread reads in real time, and the world update stops (`Sg_IsSceneLoading` `0x0081fcd0`) until it is done |
| Message windows (`TOControlMessageWindow`), the pad's press edges as scripts see them | Input: the pad word is built once per drawn frame (`Virtuos_InputManager_updateInput` `0x00632a30`); hold repeats after 0.2333 s, then every 0.1 s |
| Once per `Sg_MainLoop`, not per tick: `Ch_CalcMiddle`, the field animation (`Yi`), the v-blank counters (+2), `Sg_MainCalcRate`'s rate | The Iggy (Flash) PC menus at their own 30 fps; the speed-up booster's icon |

`Sg_SetKeepFps` (native `0x4022`, set by battle magic) has motions step by `Sg_MainCalcRate`'s rate
(`0x023cbbec`, 0x100 = one tick). That is the v-blank count since the last call, which is 2 per
`Sg_MainLoop`, or the sync data's frame in a synced scene. It is the PS2's frame-drop compensation
and stays in ticks.

## (a) Decoupled drawing at the monitor's rate

Raising the rate the easy way changes `g_FrameVsyncs`, or replaces the limiter's interval with the
monitor's. Each frame then runs `Sg_MainLoop` with one tick (fewer than 2 due), so the game runs
twice as fast at 60 fps and faster still above. The tick has to be separated from the drawn frame.
A Fahrenheit mod could do it like this:

1. **Limiter.** Hook `Game_Main`'s `Sleep` (`0x0062f3bb`) or `Phyre_PTimerWin32_GetTime`. Run
   `App_Frame` at the monitor's rate (from the swap chain's refresh rate, or with no cap), and
   present with vsync or without.
2. **Tick accumulator.** Keep the game's own `dt` (the frame's real time) and add it to a 30 Hz
   accumulator. When a tick (or several) is due, let `Sg_MainLoop` run as now, passing it the
   accumulated time as `dt`, so `Sg_FrameSync` sees the 30 fps it expects. When none is due, draw
   without updating.
3. **Drawing without a tick.** `Sg_MainLoop` both updates and builds the draw, so a frame without a
   tick needs a path that only draws. `Sg_SetExecFrames(0)` (the PS2 debug pause) is the nearest:
   the update loop runs no tick. It still runs `MsEffectProcess(0)` and the camera, and once per
   call `Ch_CalcMiddle`, the field animation, the effects' draw half (`op_loop_ffx_after`,
   `MsEffectProcess(1)`), `Sg_FrameSync`'s pad scan and v-blank count, `graphicVideoUpdate`, the
   fades and the menu update. Each of these would have to be held on frames without a tick (hooks
   that return early, or their state saved and restored), or they run at the drawn rate.
4. **Interpolation.** Save, for each tick, the state the draw reads: the camera and screen
   matrices (`MsScreenProcess`, `MsCopyCameraMatrix` `0x007c0070`, `MsCopyScreenMatrix` `0x007bba50`), each character's
   root and bone matrices (`Ch_CalcMiddle`'s output), and the field's moving parts. Before drawing a
   frame between ticks, write the lerp (slerp for rotations) of the last two ticks at the
   accumulator's fraction, and put the latest values back after. That shows the world one tick late,
   about 33 ms. Effects and particles (the VU-emulated `ppp` programs), message windows and the PS2
   2D layers have no clean state to interpolate. They would stay at 30 Hz unless each is handled.
5. **Render thread.** Phyre already draws update n while the main thread computes n + 1. A drawn
   frame without a tick is another `App_Frame` with a flip, so the handshake stays as it is (one
   flip per `App_Frame`). The cloth's staging (ffx-rust `docs/host.md`, "The cloth race") expects
   one stage per submit and needs checking.

Feasibility: steps 1-3 are a few hooks. Camera interpolation is moderate work and covers most of the
perceived smoothness on the field. Full interpolation of characters, effects and UI touches many
systems and is a large project. The 30 Hz simulation itself stays exact, and with it every frame
count, scripts included.

## (b) Fast-forward: N ticks per drawn frame

The game has three ways to run several ticks per drawn frame:

| Way | How | Limit | Draws per tick |
|---|---|---|---|
| Booster | `g_SpdCtrlScales` (`0x00c38e1c`) × `dt` → `Sg_FrameSync` → `g_VoiceHold` → `updateFFX` repeats `Sg_MainLoop` | `dt` capped at 0.3 s: at most 9 ticks per frame, about ×9 at 30 fps. Only where `SpdCtrl_ScaleElapsedTime` and `Sg_CanSpeedUp` allow (not in movies, synced scenes, the sphere grid, the excluded maps and spells) | Each repeat builds a full draw (the harness sees a double tick draw the effects twice) |
| Exec frames | `Sg_SetExecFrames(n)` (`0x0082da60`, `0x00c496d4`, clamped to 0..99): the update loop runs n ticks per `Sg_MainLoop` | 99 per `Sg_MainLoop` | One draw; the effects' draw half runs n times |
| Both | exec frames × booster hold | 99 × 9 | |

A mod for ×100 would set exec frames (for example 50) and the booster scale (×2, with the 0.3 s cap
in mind), or call `Sg_MainLoop`'s update part in a loop of its own. Some of it does not follow:

- **What runs once per `Sg_MainLoop`.** With exec frames, `Ch_CalcMiddle`, the field animation, the
  fades, `Sg_FrameSync` (pad scan, v-blank count), `graphicVideoUpdate` and the menus run once per
  drawn frame, while the world runs n ticks. Field animations and movies stay at ×1.
  `Sg_MainCalcRate` forces the motion rate to 0x100 when exec frames is not 1. The booster repeats
  all of `Sg_MainLoop`, so it has none of these gaps, but it builds a draw per tick.
- **Audio.** FMOD plays in real time. Sounds triggered per tick pile up ×N, and music and voices
  don't speed up. The booster mutes the sound (`Sg_SetMuteSound`) and mutes the battle subtitles.
- **Movies.** The video advances one frame per update and the sound plays in real time, so a faster
  update desyncs them. `Sg_CanSpeedUp` refuses a video without a movie camera, and the booster stays
  off while `g_WaitFramesByTime` is set.
- **Voice-synced cut scenes.** `g_SyncOn` paces the ticks to the sync clock (real time), so the
  booster does nothing there. Exec frames would run n ticks per synced step and leave the voices
  behind.
- **Input.** The pad word is read once per drawn frame, and the press edges once per `Sg_MainLoop`
  (`Sg_ControlMain`'s `0x023c44a8`). With exec frames, all n ticks see the same buttons. Whether a
  press then counts once or n times in each reader (menus, scripts' `Pad` natives) is not checked.
- **Loading.** Real time; the world update waits for it.
- **Render thread.** One flip per `App_Frame` either way. Exec frames draws once, so the GPU sees no
  extra work. The booster's repeats build extra draws, and the main thread does all their work.
- **CPU.** Every tick is simulated. The hook harness's `--fast` mode ran 461 whole frames (update,
  draw, present) a second on its test machine (ffx-rust `docs/harness.md`), about ×15 in full
  frames. A tick without its draw is cheaper, but this has not been measured. ×100 would be 3,000
  ticks a second, which is likely beyond one core in heavy scenes.

## Unity's timing model

How FFX.exe's timing compares with Unity's two models, and what moving it to either would take.

### What FFX.exe has today

FFX.exe is already a fixed-step simulation with an accumulator, close to Unity's `FixedUpdate`, with
four differences:

| Unity | FFX.exe |
|---|---|
| `Time.fixedDeltaTime` (0.02 s by default) | One tick, 1/30 s. The 30 and 60 are `.rdata` constants of `Sg_FrameSync` (`0x00b922c8` 30.0, `0x00b4a180` 60.0), and every system counts whole ticks (below) |
| Accumulator: 0, 1 or more `FixedUpdate`s per rendered frame | `Sg_FrameSync`'s carries (`0x012fb7f8`, `0x012fb7fc`) give 1 to 9 ticks per drawn frame, **never 0**: with fewer than 2 due, the hold is 1 and the carries are cleared. A frame faster than 1/30 s still ticks once. That is why drawing at 60 fps runs the game at ×2 |
| `Time.maximumDeltaTime` (0.333 s) | `dt` capped at 0.3 s (`0x00b3eb44`): at most 9 ticks per frame |
| `Time.timeScale`, any float | The booster's `g_SpdCtrlScales` (`0x00c38e1c`: 1, 2, 4) scales `dt` before `Sg_FrameSync`. A scale below 1 does nothing, because a frame never gets fewer than 1 tick |
| Rigidbody interpolation between the last two fixed steps | None. Each drawn frame shows the last tick |
| `Update` (once per rendered frame, `Time.deltaTime`) | Not separate. What runs once per `Sg_MainLoop` (`Ch_CalcMiddle`, the field animation, fades, the draw) is tied to the tick at 30 fps too |

### (1) Fixed step like `FixedUpdate`: realistic as a mod

This is (a) and (b) above, plus 0-tick frames and a fractional time scale:

1. **0 ticks per frame.** Hook `Sg_FrameSync` (`0x00821e80`, ported in `ffx-sg` `state.rs`
   `frame_sync`) so that ticks = ⌊(carry + `dt` × scale) × 30⌋, 0 included, with the rest carried.
   The game's own 60 Hz first test ("fewer than 2 due → 1") goes. A 0-tick frame takes the draw-only
   path of (a): `Sg_SetExecFrames(0)` plus holding what runs once per `Sg_MainLoop`.
2. **`timeScale`.** Hook `SpdCtrl_ScaleElapsedTime` (`0x006f7340`) to multiply by any float: 0.25 for
   slow motion (a tick every fourth frame at 30 fps, every eighth at 60), 100 for fast-forward. Above
   ×9, raise the 0.3 s cap or use exec frames ((b)). Unlike the booster, this works everywhere,
   including the places `SpdCtrl_IsMapExcluded` and `Sg_CanSpeedUp` exclude, so those cases (movies,
   voice-synced scenes) need a decision of their own: keep them at ×1, as the booster does.
3. **Interpolation.** As in (a) step 4: camera first, then the characters' matrices. In slow motion
   it matters more, because at 0.25 a frozen tick lasts 4 drawn frames.
4. **Real-time parts stay real time.** FMOD, movies, the sync clock and loading (the table above) are
   not ticks. Slow motion leaves the music and voices at ×1, as Unity's `timeScale` does with an
   `AudioSource` unless its pitch is changed. Scaling FMOD's pitch to match would put voice-synced scenes out of step.

The simulation stays bit-exact: the same ticks run in the same order, only spread differently over
drawn frames. Determinism, replays and every frame count in the scripts stay valid.

### (2) Variable step like `Update` with `Time.deltaTime`: belongs in the Rust port

Every system that steps once per tick would take the frame's `dt` instead. These count whole ticks
today:

| System | Where | What counts ticks |
|---|---|---|
| Script VM | `Script_Run` `0x008641e0`, through `TkUpdateEventJump` `0x0088d3d0` | One run per worker per tick. Waits are integer tick counts: `Native_WaitFrames_Poll_0000` `0x0085c6b0`, 124,718 `WaitFrames` calls in the shipped scripts |
| Natives with durations | `TurnSetFrames`, `MoveSetFrames`, `GetTurnFrames`, `SetMapFadeFrames`, the camera's eased moves (`MoveEased`, `FocusTimeEase`), message waits | Arguments in frames, compiled into the scripts as constants |
| Natives with rates | `Native_SetTurnSpeed` `0x0085a480` (radians a frame, default π/64), `MoveSpeed`, motion speeds | Per-frame steps, compiled into the scripts as constants |
| Moves and turns | `Atel_MoveUpdate_00868990` | One step of the move record per tick |
| Motion | `SG_UpdateMotion` `0x00838c90`, `SG_SeqFrame` `0x008377c0`, `Ch_MotionLoopFrame` `0x008392d0` | Time `+0x740` += speed per tick in 8.8 fixed point, so half steps exist (`g_ChrMotionHalf` `0x013017f8`, set only from a debug menu, `ChrMenu_buttons_0084cf60`; `g_FrameRate88` `0x023cbbec` with keep-fps). Sequences step in whole frames |
| Eases | `Sg_AnimValF` `0x00836020` | value += (target − value) / frames, frames −1 per tick: a per-tick ratio, not a rate |
| Collision and ground | `Atel_MoveUpdate` against the id (collision) mesh (`Sg_IdGetNormal` `0x0083e130`, id data `0x01301a84`), the player's control (`Sg_ControlPlayer` `0x0082d180`) | A move per tick, tested once per tick. A longer step could pass through thin walls |
| Cloth | `Sg_ClothStep` `0x00822de0` | One Verlet-style step with rods and collision per tick; the CRT `rand()` for wind |
| Particles and effects | The `ppp` programs (`pppDrawShapeField*Emit`, `0x00742750`..`0x00745f70`), `MsEffectProcess` `0x00787e00`, `op_loop_ffx_after` `0x007ff680` (`g_OpLoopCount` `0x023328d4`) | Integer countdowns and per-tick velocities, recompiled from PS2 EE and VU code |
| Camera | `MsCameraProcess` `0x007be110` | Channels step per tick; movie cameras use the video frame (`MovieCameraFrame_0076edc0`) |
| Battle | `MsBattleProcess` `0x00790c10` and its steps (`_Order`, `_ChrDamage`, `_Status`, `_InputCue`) | Turn order is by counter (CTB), not time, but every animation, effect and wait inside a turn counts ticks |
| Field and fades | `Yn_FieldProc_0091a8c0`, `Sg_DrawFilter` `0x0082c0c0` (i16 counters), `Pause_Update` `0x008ab340` | Per-tick counters |
| Encounters | `MsBattleEncountExe` `0x00780d10`, `ResetEncountExe` `0x00780ff0` | Rolled against step counters that the player's moves advance in the world update |
| Sound sync | `Sg_SyncCutScene` `0x00821d60` | The `SyncData` tables give a frame per step (`frame << 7` into `0x012fb828`) |
| Randomness | `g_Vu0_R` `0x00c0a000` (`op_random` `0x007e6700`, effects), the main thread's CRT `rand()` (drawn by `op_loop_ffx_after` each tick), the cloth's per-job seeds; the battle's generators (`0x00c42200`, `0x01135ee0`) | Drawn a fixed number of times per tick. With a variable step, the draw count follows the frame rate, so the same inputs give different results. The harness's replays depend on the fixed tick (ffx-rust `docs/harness.md`, "Pinned state") |

Converting these is not a mod. The durations and rates are data in 1,621 compiled scripts, the motion
and effect files and the battle tables, all in ticks. The code is PS2-era C and recompiled EE and VU
code, in thousands of functions. Ease, collision and cloth would also change behaviour (`Sg_AnimValF`'s
1/frames ratio, tunnelling, cloth stability) unless each gets a careful dt form. In the Rust port it
is possible system by system, but it gives up the port's parity with the original (ffx-rust `docs/rewrite-plan.md`,
"Determinism"). The usual compromise is model (1) with interpolation: Unity games keep physics in
`FixedUpdate` for the same reason.

### Changing the tick rate (`Time.fixedDeltaTime`), e.g. 30 → 60 Hz

Patching `Sg_FrameSync`'s constants (30 → 60, 60 → 120) and the limiter to 1 vsync gives 60 ticks a
second, and everything above runs twice as fast. Every per-tick quantity would have to be halved:

- **Scripts.** Every frame count (`WaitFrames(n)` → 2n, the turn, move, fade and camera frames) and
  every per-frame rate (turn speeds, move speeds) in all 1,621 scripts. The linker could rewrite
  constants, but computed values (`WaitFrames(V3)`, `GetTurnFrames`'s result) and frame comparisons
  (`if (count > 30)`) cannot be found mechanically.
- **Motion.** The 8.8 step could be halved (the debug `g_ChrMotionHalf` does it), but the sequences'
  whole-frame waits cannot.
- **Effects.** Integer countdowns and velocities in the `ppp` and `opus` programs, which are data.
- **Eases.** `Sg_AnimValF` over 2n frames gives a different curve unless the ratio changes too.
- **Sync data and movie cameras.** Keyed on 30 Hz frames and 29.97 Hz video frames.
- **Randomness.** Twice the per-tick draws, so a different sequence.

On FFX.exe that is not realistic: half the work would be data that cannot be told apart from other
numbers. A port could do it with each system taking its own step, which is model (2) with a fixed
step. Smooth 60+ fps is cheaper through interpolation (1), which keeps the 30 Hz simulation.

## (c) Waits shorter than a frame

None. A worker runs once per tick, and the next tick is the next time anything in the world
changes. Atel#'s `Wait.Seconds` therefore rounds to whole frames, and less than one is an error. At a
decoupled draw rate (a), a script still sees only ticks. A mod that wanted finer steps would have
to raise the tick rate itself, and that changes the meaning of every frame count in the game's
scripts and code (all of them written for 30), so it is not a mod-sized change.

## What the mod does

`mods/fps-unlock` (Fahrenheit mod `yuta.fps-unlock`; until 2026-11-08 `yuta.frames` in ffx-atel-sharp's `src/Ffx.Frames`) is model
(1) above: a fixed 30 Hz tick with an accumulator that can run 0 ticks a frame, any time scale,
and the camera and the characters interpolated. It is static work: everything below comes from
FFX.exe's code and ffx-rust's ports. Its first in-game run (2026-11-07) crashed on the first frame;
"Hooking: why the first run crashed" below has the cause. The second (2026-11-07, Unlimited, about
200 fps) kept the game's speed, but the effects (the pyreflies of the opening scene) ran about
6.7 times too fast and slow character motions looked choppy: "Effects between ticks" and
"Characters between ticks" below are the answer, not yet tested in the game. The open questions
are at the end of this section.

### The frame, hook by hook

| Where | Hook | What the mod does |
|---|---|---|
| `Game_Main` limiter (`0x0062ee50`) | Code patch: the operand of `fild dword [g_FrameVsyncs]` at `0x0062f2fc` and of `fmul qword [0x00b412d8]` (1/59.94) at `0x0062f318` | Both point at the mod's own int and double: 1 and the target interval (1/refresh, 1/fps, or 0 for no wait). With the mod off they hold `g_FrameVsyncs` and 1/59.94 again. The bytes are checked first (`db 05`, `dc 0d` and the original operands) |
| `updateFFX` (`0x00822840`), once per drawn frame | Call-site hook: its one caller, `call` at `0x0042f5b6` | Reads the game, asks the accumulator for the frame's ticks (`FrameDirector`), sets the limiter, mute and vsync. A frame without a tick either runs the update as a **Redraw** or, as a **Repeat**, returns without calling the original (what `FFXApplication::animate` does while the Esc menu is up) |
| `Sg_MainLoop` (`0x00820ae0`), once per game update | Hook, chained after Fahrenheit's own | Puts the true camera and screen matrices back before the update. On a Redraw it restores the Eternal Calm copyright counter (`0x012fb7c0`) after, and draws the title's water and the dream noise from the counters they had before the last tick's update, then puts the tick's back (`DrawCounters`) |
| `Sg_FrameSync` (`0x00821e80`) | Hook | **Tick frame**, first update: the original runs (so `Sg_SyncCutScene` and the sync clock work as before), then, unless `g_SyncOn`, its carries are cleared, `g_VoiceHold` = the plan's updates and the exec frames (`0x00c496d4`) = this update's ticks. Later updates set their own exec frames. In a voice-synced scene the game's sync-paced hold stays. **Redraw**: the original does not run at all, so the pad scan (`TkScanControler`), the v-blank counters (+2), the sync clock and the effect read poll stay put; exec frames = 0 |
| `TkUpdateScanControler` (`0x00889a80`), `Sg_ControlMain` (`0x0082d070`) | Hooks (the first at its two calls, `0x00820b84` in `Sg_MainLoop` and `0x0089ae60` in `TOControlBtlWindow`), return at once on a Redraw | The pad's port scan and the controls (press edges) run only in updates that tick, so a press is never used up by a frame without a tick |
| `MsEffectProcess` (`0x00787e00`), `op_loop_ffx_after` (`0x007ff680`) | Hooks | The effects: held on a Redraw, their draws replayed ("Effects between ticks") |
| `op_gs1_transfer` (`0x007eb580`), `yiCallFieldParticle` (`0x009083e0`), `pppPartLoop` (`0x00762240`), `op_ot_draw` (`0x007ec470`) | Call-site hooks: their one call in `Sg_MainLoop`'s effect loop (`0x00821477`, `0x0082148c`, `0x008214a2`, `0x008214ba`); their other callers keep the function | The same |
| `VfxGeometry_Register` (`0x006a52f0`, `VFXDynamicGeometry` vtable `+8`, thiscall), `graphicVFXSyncPath` (`0x00645840`), `PhyreScene_addVFXDrawEvent` (`0x00656940`, thiscall) | Hooks | Record what the effect calls above hand the renderer on a tick (game thread only) |
| `JobSchedule_Ch_Cloth_PerCharacter` (`0x00a44b40`), `Ch_DrawClothClear` (`0x00830b90`) | Hooks (switch, on) | Held on a Redraw: `Ch_DrawMain` steps the cloth once per game update |
| `Ch_DrawMain` (`0x0082ed50`), `graphicCharacterInstanceSetWorldMatrix` (`0x0063c3e0`), `…ByMdlID` (`0x0063c430`) | Hooks | Draw the characters between ticks ("Characters between ticks") |
| `graphicCharacterInstanceSetClothVertexBuffers` (`0x0063b740`, from `FFXApplication_render` `0x0042f95e`) | Hook (switch, on) | Draws the cloth between ticks: blended vertices and the drawn character's matrix written into each cloth mesh before the upload ("The cloth" below) |
| `MsCameraProcess` (`0x007be110`), `Sg_CameraSetPlayer` (`0x0083f2e0`) | Hooks | Held on a Redraw: with exec frames 0, `Sg_MainLoop` still runs both when the camera is idle (`0x012fbbb0`) |
| `Ch_CalcMiddle` (`0x00833390`) | Hook (switch, on) | Held on a Redraw. It is not idempotent: besides the bones it fires `Ch_MotEvent` (motion events). After a tick, where the characters are recorded |
| `yiAnimMain` (`0x00908320`) | Hook (switch, on) | The field's animation, held on a Redraw |
| `graphicVideoUpdate` (`0x00645df0`) | Hook | Held on a Redraw. During a movie the mod repeats instead of redrawing anyway: the picture steps per update, and for some movies per draw |
| `Sg_DrawFilter` (`0x0082c0c0`) | Hook (switch, on) | On a Redraw the fade state (`0x01300700`..`0x0130075f`: a flag word and the 5 slots at `0x01300708`) is saved, the fades drawn, and the state put back, so the counters step once per tick |
| `Sg_MainCalcRate` (`0x008206c0`) | Hook (counts) | `Sg_MainLoop` calls it only on the way to the world update. A frame whose updates never called it (menu, pause, save screen, load) makes the next frames without a tick Repeats: their logic runs once per update, and a second update would speed it up |
| `TkUpdateEventJump` (`0x0088d3d0`) | Hook (counts) | The world ticks that ran, for the window's "ticks/s" |
| `graphicCameraSetWorldMatrix` (`0x00639860`) | Hook | See "The camera" below |
| `graphicObjectSetTranslation` (`0x006426c0`), `graphicObjectSetRotation` (`0x006426a0`) | Hooks (switch `frames.interpolate.objects`, on) | Note the game's pose of each map object; after `updateFFX` the mod places the moving ones between ticks through the same two, calling the rest of their chains (a mod hooked ahead of this one sees the game's calls, not these) ("Moving map objects between ticks") |
| `MsCameraResetMove` (`0x007bed60`), `MsSetCheckChange` (`0x007c0790`) | Hooks (notes) | The game's instant camera sets: noted for the update's camera sample ("Cuts" below); `MsSetCheckChange` only while the event scripts run |
| `FFXApplication_updateGlobalTime_0042fa00` (thiscall app), `TextureAnimation_Animate_00672000` (stdcall), `CharacterLighting_updateFlash_006ab630`, `FogEffectManager_updateChrFogFade_006e3f40`, `BlurEffect_update_006c3d40` (thiscall) | Hooks (switch `frames.speed.scene_time`, on) | Game time instead of the real-time step after `updateFFX` ("The scene's clock" below) |
| `Renderer_PresentFlip` (`0x00593760`, thiscall, render thread) | Hook | Counts presents (the drawn fps). For vsync on or off it sets the renderer's byte `+0x131c` around the call (the present's sync interval is 1 when it is not 0) and puts it back |

The main menu runs at 60 fps in the game (`g_FrameVsyncs` 1), one update per frame. There the
accumulator ticks at 60 a second (60 / `g_FrameVsyncs`), so the menus keep their speed at any
frame rate, and frames between those updates are Repeats.

The time scale multiplies the frame's time before the accumulator, and so does the booster's
factor (`g_SpdCtrlScales[level]` while `g_SpdCtrl_b8` says it scaled). It stays ×1 where
`g_SyncOn`, `g_WaitFramesByTime`, `g_MovieFading` or `Sg_CanSpeedUp() == 0`. With "keep the
booster's limits" it also stays ×1 where `SpdCtrl_ScaleElapsedTime` refuses: `SpdCtrl_IsMapExcluded(g_CurrentMapNo)`,
`SpdCtrl_IsMagicExcluded` in battle, `graphicGetAbmap()` (sphere grid), `g_SaveMachineBusy`. Up to 4 ticks a frame
(configurable) are whole updates, as the booster runs them. Past that, the last update (the one
that draws) runs one tick and the rest are spread over the others through exec frames (up to 99
each), so ×100 at 144 fps is about 21 ticks per frame: 7, 7, 6 and 1. Each frame runs only as many
ticks as fit into its time budget (40 ms of update time by default), at the measured cost of a
tick ("Fast-forward: why ×18 crashed" below). Above ×1 the mod calls `Sg_SetMuteSound(1)` (and 0 again unless the booster is on).

### Findings used

- **The limiter** starts a frame when `over` = now − last − interval ≥ 0, sets last = now −
  min(over, interval) (catch-up by at most one interval), and otherwise sleeps
  `(int)(over × −1000)` ms (`0x00b41328` is −1000.0, truncated). A remaining time under 1 ms
  sleeps 0 and loops.
- **`Sg_GetCurExecFrames`** (`0x0082d7e0`) returns (byte `0x013007b1` ? byte `0x013007b2` : byte
  `0x00c496d4`) | byte `0x013007b3`, all signed bytes. The mod writes `0x00c496d4` and puts the
  value back at the end of the frame. `Sg_MainCalcRate` forces the motion rate to 0x100 when it is
  not 1.
- **The camera.** `MsScreenProcess` (`0x007bc110`), which the draw calls once per screen, computes
  `g_ScreenMatrix` (`MsScreenMatrix`) and `g_CameraMatrix` (`MsCameraMatrix`) and ends with
  `Cam_Apply`, which hands `g_CameraMatrix` to the renderer through `graphicCameraSetWorldMatrix`.
  So the renderer's view is set during each update's draw, not in the tick. A point is drawn at
  `p × camera × screen` (`l6_map.rs`): the screen matrix is view to screen, separate from the
  camera. `MsCopyCameraMatrix`/`MsCopyScreenMatrix` copy the two globals and have 13 and 10 callers
  (effects, the sound's camera position, `UpdatePhyreViewProjectionMatrix`).
- **The pad.** `TkUpdateScanControler` (each `Sg_MainLoop`, before `Sg_FrameSync`) scans the ports.
  `TkScanControler` (in `Sg_FrameSync`) runs `Pad_UpdateFrame`, and `Sg_ControlMain` reads the
  history.

### Hooking: why the first run crashed

Fahrenheit (alpha12) hooks with MinHook. `MH_CreateHook` overwrites a function's first 5 bytes with
`jmp detour`, copies the whole instructions it overwrote into a trampoline, and ends the trampoline
with a `jmp` back to the first byte after them. Fahrenheit chains several hooks on one function by
hooking the previous trampoline, and a hook's `chain_from(hook).fnptr` is that trampoline. MinHook
does not check whether the function itself branches into bytes 1 to 4. Such a branch lands inside
the `jmp`'s address and runs it as code.

Two of the functions the mod hooked do branch there, both with a loop whose head is the third byte:

- `TkUpdateScanControler`: `push esi; xor esi, esi`, then the pad loop from `0x00889a83`
  (`push 0` …, `inc esi; cmp esi, 2; jl 0x00889a83`). The first pad runs through the trampoline;
  the second jumps to `+3`.
- `updateFFX`: `push ebp; mov ebp, esp`, then the update loop from `0x00822843`
  (`cmp [0x0133c930], 0` … `jne 0x00822843` at `0x00822876`) while `g_VoiceHold` is not 0.

Both minidumps of the run match this. In one, the fault is at `TkUpdateScanControler+3` (`07`, `pop
es`, from the `jmp`'s address bytes: a general-protection fault, reported as a read of
`0xffffffff`) with `esi` = 1, the loop counter after the first pad, and the stack as it is after
the first call. In the other, the fault is at `updateFFX+8`: from `+3` the `jmp`'s bytes ran as
`stosd; add al, 0x30; leave`, then the game's own `pop ebp`, then `add [eax], eax` with `eax` = 0x30.
Which one crashes first depends on whether the first frame ran more than one update. In both dumps
the crashed function starts with MinHook's `jmp` followed by the game's own bytes, and every other
thread is waiting in the system (so no hook was being installed at the time).

No other function the mod hooks has a branch into its first 5 bytes. A scan of `.text` for `jmp`,
`jcc` and `call` to bytes 1 to 4 of every hooked function finds only the two above, and no
absolute address points there. The fix:

- **Call-site hooks.** `updateFFX` has one caller (`0x0042f5b6`) and `TkUpdateScanControler` two.
  The mod checks that each is `e8 rel32` to the function and points the `rel32` at its own entry,
  which calls the function. The prologues stay untouched.
- **Checked before install.** For every function hooked through Fahrenheit the mod knows its length
  (to the next function in `ffx.sym`) and scans it for `jmp`/`jcc` (rel8 or rel32) into bytes 1
  to 4, at every offset, without decoding (`CodeScan`). One hit and nothing is installed. `loop`
  and `jcxz` are left out: MSVC does not emit them, and a stray `e0` in `MsCameraProcess` would be
  a false hit.
- **Checked after install.** The first time a hook runs, its next link must exist, must not be the
  function itself, the function must start with `e9`, and the link must start with the function's
  first byte (a trampoline) or `e9` (another hook over it, as on `Sg_MainLoop`, which Fahrenheit's
  game-loop events hook too). Otherwise the mod passes through from then on and logs why.

**The check refused a safe function at some load bases (2026-11-08).** A run reported
"Sg_FrameSync (0x00821e80) cannot be hooked: the code at 0x00821ea0 branches into its first 5
bytes" and installed nothing; the same build had run before. There is no such branch: at
`0x00821e9d` is `fld dword [0x00b3eb44]`, and the scan, which has no decoder and tries every
offset, read the operand's bytes `eb b3` at `0x00821ea0` as a `jmp rel8`. FFX.exe is
`DYNAMICBASE` (it has 0x8f0e4 bytes of base relocations), and the check reads the live code: at
another base the loader rewrites that operand, and loaded anywhere from 0x6c0000 to 0x700000 (or
the same 64 KB steps higher up) its third byte is `df`..`e3`, so the "jmp" lands on bytes 1 to
4. Five entries are affected this way, at a share of all 64 KB-aligned bases each: `Sg_FrameSync`
(508 of 32,767), `Sg_ControlMain` (4,096), `MsCameraProcess` (1,020), `MsCameraResetMove` (508) and
`MsSetCheckChange` (512). Runs at the crash dump's base 0x3d0000 passed; the refusing run's base
was in one of those ranges. The check now reads the image's relocation table (`PeRelocations`)
and skips every candidate branch with a byte the loader rewrites: a direct branch is relative and
never relocated, so a real one is still found, and the result no longer depends on the base. A
test scans every hooked function over FFX.exe's own bytes relocated to many bases, and checks
that no fixed byte of a pattern is relocated. The error line now also logs the load base.

### Fast-forward: why ×18 crashed

Reported on ffx-atel-sharp's main (`fa093ad`), target Unlimited, vsync off: above about ×18 the game froze, then
crashed, with no crash dump and nothing in the log; ×100 crashed too. Then the saved ×18.42 crashed
the game at once on every start-up. Two things together; the second one alone is the crash:

1. **A spiral.** A frame's update time is about `d + w × n` for `n` ticks. When the scale asks for
   more ticks a second than `1 / w`, each frame takes longer than the last, owes more ticks for it,
   and so on up to the 0.3 s cap: ⌊0.3 × 30 × 18⌋ = 162 ticks, cut to "most ticks per frame" (100).
   At 2 to 3 ms a tick, 100 ticks are a quarter of a second a frame: the freeze. ×18 is where
   heavy scenes cross `1 / w` (540 ticks a second needs `w` under 1.85 ms). At start-up no spiral
   is needed: the first world frame follows the load, its real time is at the 0.3 s cap, and it
   owes ⌊0.3 × 30 × 18.42⌋ = 165 ticks at once (100 above ×11.1). The title and the menus are not
   at risk: `Sg_MainCheckMenu` sends `Sg_MainLoop` past the world and the effect loop.
2. **The VFX path table.** The old plan spread 100 ticks evenly over 4 updates: 25 exec frames
   each, the last update included. `Sg_MainLoop`'s effect loop runs one pass per exec frame
   (`n = exec ? exec : 1`), and each pass ends in `op_ot_draw`, which calls
   `graphicVFXSyncPath` → `PhyreScene_VFXSyncPath` (`0x00654cc0`). That writes the current list
   lengths (`+0xf8cc`, `+0xf8d0`) into two arrays of 16 at `+0xf8d4` and `+0xf914`, indexed by the
   path count at `+0xf954`, and adds one, with no bound check. The 17th path writes `+0xf954`
   itself with the second list's length (up to `0xc00`), and the next paths write that far past
   the scene object: heap corruption, which ends the process later without an exception the crash
   handler sees. `PhyreScene_addChrDrawSituation` (`0x006564a0`) and the scene's draw
   (`0x00654650`) add paths too, also unchecked. The counter is reset once per drawn frame (after
   the scene's draw at `0x00654650`, and in its clear at `0x00654b70`).

   All path writers sit behind `g_GraphicSkipFrame == 0` (`graphicVFXSyncPath`,
   `graphicCharacterInsertDrawSituation`, and the other `graphicVFXAdd*Event` functions).
   `Sg_MainLoop` sets it to 1 while `g_VoiceHold` is 2 or more, so of a frame's updates only the
   last adds paths (the booster's extra updates skip their VFX submissions the same way). The
   game itself never runs exec frames above 1 on PC (the debug fast-forward is the PS2's), so a
   drawing update has one pass.

The fix:

- **One tick in the drawing update** (`TickPlan`): with exec frames, the last update runs 1 and
  the others share the rest (99 each at most, so 298 a frame with 4 updates). The drawing update
  now has one effect pass, as in the game. The effects are drawn once a frame, from its last tick.
- **A start-up ramp** (`ScaleGuard`): a session starts at ×1 and the most scale allowed doubles
  each second of world frames (a frame counts at most 0.1 s, so a load does not count), so the
  first world frame runs 9 ticks as the game would and ×18.42 is reached after about 4.2 s. A
  scale above ×1 is written to the settings file only after 5 s of world frames at it, so a scale
  that crashes is never saved. Below ×1 nothing is limited. While the scale is ×1 the mod also
  does not call the game's booster checks (`Sg_CanSpeedUp`, `SpdCtrl_IsMapExcluded`, …).
- **A time budget** (`TickBudget`): the cost of a tick is the update time over its ticks,
  averaged (one quarter of each new frame; a measurement counts as at most the budget, so a load
  does not hold the speed down). A frame runs at most ⌊budget / cost⌋ ticks, at least 1. Because
  the cost counts the frame's fixed part, the limit settles where the update takes the budget:
  `n = (budget − d) / w`. The ticks owed beyond it are dropped, not carried, and counted: the
  overlay shows `scale × run / (run + dropped)` when it is more than 2 % short.

`StartupTests` takes the settings saved at the crash: a load's frame (0.3 s, 5 s, endless) runs
100 ticks with 1 in the drawing update (main: 25), the boundary at ×11.1 changes nothing but the
count, and the ramp starts at 9 ticks.

The heap overwrite is read from the code, not seen in a dump (there was none). It predicts that on
main a saved scale of about ×7 or more also crashes on the first world frame (100 / 4 ≥ 16 passes
needs 64 ticks, ⌊9 × 7.1⌋). The in-game check is that start-up with ×18.42 saved and ×18 to ×100
in play no longer crash.

Modelled in `FastForwardTests` (`d` = 4 ms, `w` = 2.5 ms, unlimited fps): without the budget ×18
settles at 100 ticks and 255 ms a frame; with it, ×18 to ×100 settle at 14 ticks and 40 ms a frame,
about ×11.7 reached; ×4 drops nothing.

### The camera

After each update that ticked, `graphicCameraSetWorldMatrix(&g_CameraMatrix)` (from `Cam_Apply`) is
the tick's camera. The mod records it with `g_ScreenMatrix`. Then, and on every Redraw, it writes the
camera between the last two ticks into both globals before the call goes on, so the renderer, the
effects' fill matrices and the rest of the draw use it. `Sg_MainLoop`'s hook puts the true matrices
back before the next update. A Repeat frame has no draw, so the mod sets the globals and calls
`graphicCameraSetWorldMatrix` itself. The camera matrix is taken apart into a scale on the view's
axes (or the world's), a rotation and the eye. The rotation is slerped, the eye and scale lerped.
The screen matrix is lerped element by element. A move over 100 units or a turn over 45° in one tick
(both configurable), or a screen matrix that changed by a quarter, is a cut and is drawn as it is.
The mod does not interpolate during a movie, with the part matrix on (`0x012fb8f9`), or for a
second screen's camera (one that is not the recorded one).

**Cuts.** In the 2026-11-07 test of [ffx-atel-sharp PR #66](https://github.com/yutamago/ffx-atel-sharp/pull/66) (characters on), a hard cut from one shot to the next
drew the camera cut but slid the characters into place from where they stood in the last shot
(fades hid it). A cut now applies to everything: at the tick where the camera cut, every
character and every cloth mesh is drawn as the tick has it, as a warp is, and the next tick blends
from there. Two signals make a cut:

- the thresholds above;
- the game's own instant sets:
  - `MsCameraResetMove(camera, flags)` (`0x007bed60`) with `flags` bit 3 clear stops a camera
    side's move and puts it at its target now. Its callers are the scripts' cut natives
    (`Native_CamFocusCut` 0x6034, `Native_CamMoveFinish` 0x6016), `MsAtelResetMoveCameraID`
    (`0x007ba860`) and the magic files' `opu_camera`; the battle's slot resets pass bit 3.
  - `MsSetCheckChange(camera, side, step, mode)` (`0x007c0790`) while the event scripts run
    (inside `TkUpdateEventJump`). Every request setter ends there to put a side, its roll or
    its depth at the target now when no move runs: `MsCameraSetRect` (the scripts'
    `CamSetPos` 0x6002 and `CamRefSetPos` 0x6020, through `0x007bb6a0`), `Cam_SetPolar`,
    the focus, aim, spline and battle setters (the shot setups such as `CamFocusOrbitScaled`
    0x6041). Outside the scripts it says nothing: `MsCameraSetRect` also runs every tick for
    the field camera's follow (`CameraPath_follow`), the spline moves and the draw's
    `Sg_CameraPutRects`.

  A snapped tick is a cut when its step jumps: it moved over 0.5 units or turned over 0.5°, and
  by more than three times the step of the tick before (the screen: relative change over 1e-3
  and three times the last). A script that sets its camera on every tick (a move of its own)
  steps evenly and stays interpolated. Setting "The game's instant camera sets are cuts", on;
  the window's Live line counts these apart.

**Why the camera slid in slow motion** (2026-11-08, ×0.1, Unlimited): the hard cuts there were
script shot changes under the thresholds (less than 100 units, 45°) that do not go through
`MsCameraResetMove`; the scripts set the new shot with `CamSetPos`/`CamRefSetPos` or a shot
setup, which apply at once through `MsSetCheckChange`. Nothing marked them, so the camera was
blended from the old shot to the new one over the tick, ten frames at ×0.1. A cut that is
detected holds until the next tick: the frames between are Redraws, which push no camera
sample, so `CameraHistory.Cut` stays set and each of them draws the tick's camera.

The camera is only known in `MsScreenProcess`, after `Ch_DrawMain` has drawn the characters
between ticks in the same update. So at a cut the mod also puts that draw back: the world
matrices it corrected are sent again as the game made them (`graphicCharacterInstanceSetWorldMatrix`
/ `…ByMdlID`), and the tick's bones are written back. The cloth's upload comes after the update and
finds nothing to blend.

**The crash this put back first (2026-11-08).** A build of [ffx-atel-sharp PR #66](https://github.com/yutamago/ffx-atel-sharp/pull/66) crashed in the opening, right
after Tidus gets up at the campfire (the flashback starts), at target Game. It faulted reading
`[0 + 4]` in `PhyreScene_setMeshInstanceWorldMatrix` (`0x0066d810`, `mov ecx, [esi+4]` at
`0x0066d824`), called from `graphicCharacterInstanceSetWorldMatrix` (`0x0063c3e0`, which passes each
`[list + 4][i]`); the null instance was slot 0 of the list. The minidump's stack: `Sg_MainLoop` →
`MsScreenProcess` → `Cam_Apply` → the mod's camera hook → this "put back" replay, on a list
`Ch_DrawMain` had logged in an earlier update. Two faults:

- At target Game a tick frame's alpha was the accumulator's left-over (the limiter's jitter), so
  the mod drew the characters a fraction behind and logged corrected world matrices, at 30 fps
  where there is nothing between ticks. Now at target Game and ×1 or faster every frame's alpha
  is 1, and the camera, the characters and the cloth all pass through (`FrameDirector.DrawsBetweenTicks`).
- The log was emptied only when `Ch_DrawMain` ran. An update without it (the scene change) kept
  the last one's lists, freed since. Now the log belongs to one update (`WorldMatrixLog`), and
  each list is checked before the write: still an active character's `+0x830`/`+0x838`, the same
  count and instance array as logged, no null instance. A list that fails is left as the game has it.

The cloth upload also checks what it walks: the character's flags bit 21 (cloth set up, as
`Ch_UpdateClothMatrix` and `Sg_ClothPlaceAnchors` need), aligned record, list and mesh pointers,
and 16-aligned vertex buffers.

### Effects between ticks

**Why they ran fast.** The draw's effect loop (`Sg_MainLoop`, `0x0082141d`..`0x008214ca`; port
`m5main_loop.rs` `draw`) runs once per game update, Redraws included, and per pass calls
`op_loop_ffx_after`, `op_gs1_transfer`, `yiCallFieldParticle` (`pppFpLoop` `0x00729ab0`, the map's
particles: the pyreflies), `MsEffectProcess(1)` (`op_effect_run_after`), `pppPartLoop` and
`op_ot_draw`. None of these only draws. `pppFpLoop` counts each effect's countdown down and runs
its `ppp` program (`pppRunPartFp`), which moves the particles and writes their vertices in the
same pass; `pppPartLoop` steps its parts' countdowns; `op_loop_ffx_after` steps `g_OpLoopCount`
and the effects' pad and random latches. The game itself treats the loop as per tick: with exec
frames n it runs n passes (`n = exec ? exec : 1`). So on a Redraw frame the effects stepped once
more, about 200 / 30 = 6.7 times too fast at 200 fps.

**Why holding them flickered.** The Remaster hands the effects to PhyreEngine as
`VFXDynamicGeometry` objects, and each one is drawn only in a frame where something registers it:

- `VfxGeometry_Register` (vtable `+8`; reached from `graphicVFXUpdate`, `graphicVFXUpdateWithType`
  and the other `graphicVFX*` updates) updates the geometry's render data and puts it on the
  scene's VFX list (ffx-rust `docs/formats/effects-draw.md`, "The VFX lists of `PhyreScene`").
- `graphicClearSpecialRenderList` empties those lists at the start of every `Sg_MainLoop`.
- The vertices live in the dynamic-geometry memory (`g_DynGeoFillBuffer`), two buffers that flip
  once per drawn frame (`graphicDynGeoMemManagerSwapBuffer` from `FFXApplication::afterGraphicSync`).
  The flip resets the new buffer and `ClassVFXRenderDataTable_ClearVFXDrawData` clears every
  segment's entry for it (`+0x34 + 0x1c n`), so a geometry nobody wrote this frame has no vertices.
- The Esc menu shows a still picture with its effects by stopping both: `animate` skips the update
  and `afterGraphicSync` stops swapping once the menu is up.

**What the mod does (Replay, the default).** On a tick, while each of the six calls runs (the
effect loop's five and `MsEffectProcess(0)` in the update), the mod records, in order, every
`VfxGeometry_Register(geometry, flags)` with `g_VfxCurrentType`, every `graphicVFXSyncPath` (the
list's draw paths) and every `PhyreScene_addVFXDrawEvent` (16-byte screen fade, buffer copy,
character and lighting events). A new `Sg_MainLoop` with ticks starts empty, and each pass of the
effect loop empties the loop's five, so the last pass is what is kept. On a Redraw frame the six
calls and `op_loop_ffx_after` do not run. In each one's place the mod replays its record:

1. The geometry must still be in `g_VFXRenderDataTable` (its `std::map` walked once per update, as
   `ClearVFXDrawData` walks it). A geometry destroyed since is left out (counted as "gone").
2. Each segment of its render data with vertices in the previous buffer and none in the current
   one gets a block in the current buffer (`graphicDynGeoMemManagerGetBufferForSegment`, which
   records it as the segment's current arrays) and its five arrays copied: positions (12 bytes a
   vertex), colours (16), normals (12), uvs (8), indices (2), with the counts the previous buffer
   recorded.
3. `VfxGeometry_Register` runs again with the recorded flags and type; sync paths and draw events
   run again in between, with the event's list position recomputed by the game.

The effects therefore step 30 times a second and are drawn on every frame, each at its last tick's
shape. Whether they follow the interpolated camera depends on the space of their vertices: the
field particles' loop sets Phyre's view projection from the camera (`UpdatePhyreViewProjectionMatrix`)
and keeps the camera's inverse as its fill matrix, which points to world space, but this is not
checked in the game. If they are in screen space, an effect trails a moving camera by up to one
tick. Settings: **Run** gives the old
behaviour (the five run on every frame), **Hold** holds them without a replay (they then flicker).

What it does not cover: state an effect sets only while it runs (the map particles' point lights,
`pppFpPointLightProc`), particles built facing the tick's camera, and the extra passes of exec
frames above ×4 per frame. Repeat frames are not replayed: there the flip still clears the
segments, so effects may be missing on Repeat frames (as before).

### Characters between ticks

On by default since its in-game check (2026-11-08: bones, hair and cloth smooth, hard cuts snapped).
It was off while the bone-job race below was open.

**Why slow motions were choppy.** Only the camera was interpolated; with `Ch_CalcMiddle` held, a
character's pose changed 30 times a second against a 200 fps camera.

**Where the draw gets them.** `Ch_DrawMain` builds each character's world matrix as `scale(1000) ×
+0x1d0` (`FFXVu0MulMatrix(out, a, b)` is `cdc_Mul4x4`, which computes `b × a` in row-vector
form), a part of a model that is not skinned as `base element × scale × +0x1d0`, and hands them to
`graphicCharacterInstanceSetWorldMatrix(list, m)` / `…ByMdlID(list, m, model)` for the instance
lists `+0x830` and `+0x838`. The bones are not in `Ch_DrawMain`: `Ch_CalcElement` (inside
`Ch_CalcMiddle_Batch`, on the job workers) copies them into every renderer instance with
`graphicCharacterInstanceSetSkeletonMatrices` (`0x0063be60`): instance list `[list] & 0x7fffffff`
instances at `[list + 4]`; per instance `[[instance] + 0x18] & 0x7fffffff` matrices of 64 bytes at
`[instance + 0xc]`, remapped from the character's bone array.

**What the mod does.** After `Ch_CalcMiddle` returns in a game update with ticks, each active
character's `+0x1d0` (keyed by its slot, identity = its id and instance list) and each of its
instances' bone matrices (keyed by the instance, identity = the array and count) go into a two-tick
history. Nothing is written into the bone arrays during the update: `Ch_CalcMain` ends by queueing
the ordinary characters' bone jobs (`JobSchedule_Ch_CalcMiddle_Batch`, pass 0) without waiting, and
only `Ch_CalcMiddle`'s first call (`JobScheduleWait_Ch_CalcMiddle_Batch` at `0x008333ad`) waits for
them. (The first version put the last tick's bones back on `Ch_CalcMiddle`'s entry, raced those
jobs, and recorded old poses as new: in the 2026-11-07 test, characters were choppy and half a
character could stand still for a second while its pass-1 parts moved.) Instead, when recording,
an instance whose array still holds exactly what the mod last wrote was not updated by the game
this tick, so its last true bones are written back and recorded again. In each
`Ch_DrawMain` (ticks and Redraws), for a character with two consecutive samples of the same
identity and no warp:

- the correction `+0x1d0⁻¹ × lerp(+0x1d0)` (rotation slerped, translation and scale lerped) is
  applied on the right of every world matrix `Ch_DrawMain` hands the renderer for its lists
  (`+0x1d0` itself stays true: the cloth, the cull, the shadows and the game read it);
- every bone matrix of its instances is written as the slerp/lerp of its two samples (the poses of
  each tick taken apart once, when recorded); the rest stay the tick's own.

A warp is a move over 50 units or a turn over 120° in one tick (settings), a mirror that flips, or
a matrix that cannot be taken apart and changed by a quarter. A character missing from the last
tick, a new identity in the slot or a new map (`g_CurrentMapNo`) starts again. A camera cut (above,
"Cuts") draws every character as the tick has it. A `+0x1d0` that
changed since the tick (magic `0x275`'s matrix swap) is drawn as it is.

**The cloth.** `Ch_DrawMain` queues `Ch_Cloth_PerCharacter` (`Apply_Envelope`, `Sg_ClothStep`,
`Sg_ClothPlaceAnchors`) for every cloth character once per game update, after
`Ch_DrawClothClear`, so on Redraw frames the cloth simulated once per drawn frame. The mod skips
both on a Redraw (setting, on). `FFXApplication_render` uploads the cloth's vertex records on every
drawn frame (`graphicCharacterInstanceSetClothVertexBuffers`), so without more the cloth keeps its
last tick's shape and place, as on a Repeat frame.

That is what the hair did in the 2026-11-07 test (ffx-atel-sharp main `fa093ad`, characters on, ×0.1): the bones
were smooth, the hair trailed and moved only on ticks. **The hair is cloth**, not bones: the
simulated pieces of a model's cloth table are the hair strands and crests as well as the shorts
and coats (Wakka's crest is piece (0, 3), 255 pinned and 50 moving vertices; [`models.md`](models.md), "Cloth"). How the cloth is drawn (ffx-rust `docs/formats/scene-chars.md`,
"Cloth"; `docs/formats/main.md`, "Cloth anchors"; `crates/ffx-chara/src/cloth.rs`):

- A character's render cloth `chr + 0x834` is the record the renderer lists (`0x00ccb250` count,
  `0x00ccb254` slots): `+8` hidden, `+0xc` state (2 once set up), `+0x14` lists from `+0x30`,
  each a `u32` count and mesh pointers. A mesh: 16 floats of matrix at `+0` (the shader's
  `ClothWorld`), model `u16 +0x40`, piece `+0x42`, vertex count `+0x44`, vertices `[+0x4c]` (16
  bytes each, vertex stream 5).
- **The vertices** are relative to the model's base element: `Apply_Envelope` (`0x00832110`) skins
  the PS2 model with base⁻¹ × element, `Sg_ClothStep` (`0x00822de0`) moves the free points, and
  `Sg_ClothPlaceAnchors` (`0x0082dbc0`) puts each drawn vertex on its simulated triangle
  (barycentric weights). Once per game update, on the job workers; `Sg_MainLoop` waits for them at
  its end.
- **The matrix** is written by `Ch_UpdateClothMatrix` (`0x008314c0`, first thing in `Ch_DrawMain`'s
  walk for each shown character, every draw): the base element's global matrix (`chr + 0x328`
  elements `+0x88`, translation × 1000) × the character's `+0x1d0` × diag(−1, −1, 1, 1)
  (`g_ChrClothFlip` `0x00b92340`), in row-vector order (`mul4x4(a, b)` is `b × a`).

So the cloth reads the true `+0x1d0` and the tick's skeleton, never the renderer bones the mod
writes. **What the mod does** (`ClothHistory`, setting "Interpolate the characters' cloth", on;
needs the cloth held): at the end of a game update that recorded the characters, each mesh's
vertices and its local matrix L = `ClothWorld × flip × +0x1d0⁻¹` (the base element's matrix) go
into a two-tick history (keyed by the mesh, identity = the vertex buffer and count). In the hook
on `graphicCharacterInstanceSetClothVertexBuffers` (main thread, before the upload), for a
character `Ch_DrawMain` drew between ticks: the vertices are the lerp of their two ticks (a vertex
that did not move is left exactly as it is), the matrix is lerp(L) × the drawn `+0x1d0` × flip.
With one sample, or with the bones not interpolated, the tick's cloth is carried along with the
character (L × drawn `+0x1d0` × flip). As with the bones, a mesh that still holds what the mod
wrote when the next tick is recorded was not written by the game, and gets its last true sample
back. `Ch_UpdateClothMatrix` writes the true matrix again on every draw, and the cloth job
overwrites every bound vertex on every tick, so nothing the mod writes reaches the simulation.

### Moving map objects between ticks

**The oversight.** With the camera and the characters drawn between ticks, the map's own moving
objects still moved 30 times a second: the field's animated parts, lifts, gates, a crane, boats,
anything the event scripts move. They stepped against a smooth camera.

**How the game places them** (ffx-rust `docs/formats/scene.md`, "Round 2: open questions";
`docs/formats/render.md`, "Object translation/rotation"). Every game update, the field's draw
(`yiDisp`, then `yiRender_draw`) and the event scripts (`yiSetRotTransDObj`, `yiSetRotTransGroup`)
call `graphicObjectSetTranslation(id, pos)` and `graphicObjectSetRotation(id, angles, order)`. These
reach `PhyreScene_setObjectTranslation`/`Rotation`, which find the object id in the scene's object
tree (head at scene `+0x1198`, root `+0xc`, children `+0`/`+4`, key `+0xc`, node `+0x10` a pointer to
its mesh list: `+0` count, `+8` the meshes) and rewrite each mesh's 3x4 world matrix (`*(mesh +4)`):
the translation words 8 to 10 as `(-x, -y, z)`; the rotation as 10 × the turns about x (`-x`), y
(`-y`) and z (`+z`) in the order `order` names. The game reads nothing back from these matrices; it
keeps its objects' state in its own records. `FFXApplication_render` reads them after `updateFFX`.

**What the mod does** (`ObjectHistory`, setting "moving objects", `frames.interpolate.objects`, on):

- Both functions are hooked. The game's own calls are noted per object id (the position and the
  angles with their order, each kept from the last call), with the object's identity: its tree node
  and its mesh list, so a new map, a battle's scene or a reload, which build new nodes, never get
  another object's pose.
- At the end of each game update that ran a tick, every object the game set in it goes into a
  two-tick history (as for the characters).
- After `updateFFX` of a frame drawn between ticks (Tick or Redraw, alpha under 1), every object
  with two consecutive samples of the same identity and shape and no warp is placed at the frame's
  alpha through the same two functions (the rest of their hook chains): the position lerped, each
  angle turned the short way. The characters' warp thresholds apply (`frames.cuts.character_*`);
  a camera cut draws every object as its tick has it. An object the game set to something else
  since its tick is drawn as the game set it.
- Before the next `updateFFX`, every object the mod placed gets the game's own last pose back (only
  while the tree still holds the same node), so an object the game stops moving does not stay
  where the mod drew it. A new map (`g_CurrentMapNo`) forgets everything. If the mod stops
  (pass-through after an error), the objects it placed get the game's poses back once.

**Checked in the game** (2026-11-09, harness slots, 144 fps, vsync off; the test trace below; see
"Testing"). A scan of every third developer save (6 s each) found map objects that move at the map's
start on two maps: map 119 (developer save 41, objects 23 and 24) and map 71 (developer save 5,
object 3). The drawn matrix (as the renderer reads it, after the update), frames a second it
changed, over the run's time on the map:

| Map, object | Frame rate | Objects off | Objects on |
|---|---|---|---|
| 119 (a camp's tent, developer save 41), objects 23 and 24 (swaying banners) | 122 to 142 fps | 28.4 a second (the ticks) | 121.7 of 121.7 (every frame) |
| 71 (the Al Bhed ship's deck, developer save 5), object 3 | 125 to 130 fps | 27.5 a second | 130.1 of 130.3 |
| 119 at ×0.1 (slow motion) | 106 fps | - | 98.4 of 105.6 (the rest: frames the scene was loading or cut) |

Off, the value holds for four or five frames and steps at each tick; on, it moves on every frame
between the same tick values. The world stayed at 29.4 to 30.0 ticks a second either way. Objects
that stood still over a tick (two equal samples) are left as the game set them. Nothing in the
logs; no crash in 5 runs (and a scan of 37 developer saves).

### Testing

`YUTA_FPS_UNLOCK_TRACE=<file>` (an environment variable of the game) writes a line per drawn frame
after the update and the mod's placing: time (ms), frame kind, alpha, ticks, map, and per map
object the game set lately: its first mesh's translation words and words 0 and 2 of its matrix as the
renderer reads them, whether the mod placed it, and the game's own pose. ffx-remix's
`tools/fpsunlock-compat.sh` runs it in harness slots and `tools/fpsunlock-compat.py` counts, per
object, how many frames a second its drawn matrix changed (the frame rate when it is drawn between
ticks, about 30 when not). The ffx-rust harness hook patches `Renderer_PresentFlip` before
Fahrenheit's hooks go in; the mod's hook goes in after it and so runs before it ("Limits", the paragraph on hooking: a function that
starts with another program's `jmp` and is otherwise as expected).

### Other things that advance per drawn frame

What each `Sg_MainLoop` runs once besides the ticks, and what the mod does with it on a Redraw:

| What | Where | On a Redraw |
|---|---|---|
| The effects | the effect loop, above | held, replayed |
| The cloth | `Ch_DrawMain` → `Ch_Cloth_PerCharacter` | held; drawn blended between ticks |
| Bones, motion events, mouths, texture animations of the characters | `Ch_CalcMiddle` | held; bones interpolated |
| Field animation (the map's texture animation frames, moving parts) | `yiAnimMain` | held. `yiRender_draw` only applies the frame; the moving parts are then placed between ticks |
| Fades | `Sg_DrawFilter` | drawn, counters put back |
| The Eternal Calm copyright | `Sg_MainLoop` | counter put back |
| The video | `graphicVideoUpdate` | held; movies Repeat |
| Pad scan, controls, v-blank counters, sync clock | `TkUpdateScanControler`, `Sg_ControlMain`, `Sg_FrameSync` | held |
| Sound queue (`TkSndUpdate2`, after `AtelDrawNoTrans`), `graphicMenuUpdate`, `SaveManagerUpdate` | the draw | run: real-time or idempotent as far as read; not checked in the game |
| The title's water: `PhyreScene_drawMainMenuWaveEffect` (`0x0065b5b0`, via `graphicDrawMainMenuWaterEffect` `0x0063e920` while `0x025d5ebc` is set) draws `menu/titl/Water_%02d`, one of 70, then steps the frame byte `0x00ccba09` and a count byte `0x00ccba0a` | the draw | drawn from the last tick's frame, counters put back (new: before, it ran 200 / 30 times too fast at 200 fps) |
| The dream and recall scenes' noise: `graphicDrawDream` (`0x0063df70`, via `recallSceneEffect` `0x00822580` / `recallSceneEffect2` `0x00822620` in `drawDreamEffect`) steps `0x00ccb46c` (16 bits) 0, 1, 2 and draws its speckles at 0 | the draw | drawn with the last tick's cycle, put back (new). It calls `rand()` for the speckles, so a Redraw still draws them at new places |
| The scene's own animations: the shaders' `GlobalTime`, texture animations, light flash, character fog fade (step: the frame's real time), the radial blur (+0.098 per frame) | `FFXApplication_animate` after `updateFFX`, every drawn frame, Repeats too | game time ("The scene's clock" below) |
| Screen effects (`yiDrawScrEffect` → `yiScreff_entry` `0x009131d0`), `graphicMenuUpdate` (`MenuManager_UpdateMenu` `0x0067faa0`: swaps the menu's buffer chain or sets up its instances) | the draw | run: no counter of their own found |

The title (New Game, Load) runs at 30 fps on the world path (it reaches `Sg_MainCalcRate`), so its
frames between ticks are Redraws and step what the draw steps. The other menus do not: the
in-game main menu runs at 60 fps (Redraw needs 2 vsyncs), and the main menu, the save screen and
the Sphere Grid (`eiAbmCalc` from the menu controller `TkMenuCtrlAbilityMap2` `0x008e26d0`,
`eiAbmDraw` behind `g_GraphicSkipFrame`) go through `Sg_MainCheckMenu`, which skips the world
update and the draw (`LAB_008215f4`). Their frames between ticks are Repeats and run nothing of
the game. A menu that opens on a Redraw frame runs once on that frame (the mod sees the menu only
after it): one extra step when it opens.

### The scene's clock

**The bug (2026-11-08).** At ×0.1 everything slowed down but the scrolling clouds in the sky and the
moving reflections on the water at the opening's campfire; at ×1 and high fps they looked right.
So they ran on real time, not on draws or ticks.

**What drives them.** `PApplication::frame` (`0x00627940`) sets the application's step
(`FFXApplication +0x24`, f32) to the frame's real time (`QueryPerformanceCounter`, through
`Phyre_PTimerWin32_GetTime` `0x0042fd80`). `FFXApplication_animate` (`0x0042f520`) passes it to
`updateFFX` (which the mod's tick plan replaces) and then to two more functions the plan never
touched:

- `FFXApplication_updateGlobalTime_0042fa00`: `GlobalTime` (`+0x3b0`) += step while the game is not
  paused, not loading and the free camera does not hold it; 0 again from 2400 s on; copied to
  `+0x120`, the shaders' `scene.GlobalTime`. The shaders hold only scroll speeds and multiply them by
  it: `PhyreUVAnimationShader` (`ScrollSpeed_X/Y`; the clouds and the other UV-animated surfaces of
  the maps and battle backgrounds), `PhyreWaterShader` (`ScrollSpeed_tex0/nml1/tex1/nml2_X/Y`, set by
  the water's `WaterWaveController_setScrollSpeed`; the campfire's water, the sea, rivers,
  waterfalls), `PhyreIceShader`, `PhyreWaveShader` and two VFX water shaders (their reflection
  names in the D3D11 shaders). This is the bug.
- `PhyreScene_animate` (`0x00657140`) reads the step once and hands it on: to the PC's texture
  animations (`TextureAnimation_Animate_00672000`: each `TextureAnimationInfo`'s timer and frame,
  the maps' and characters' `G<n>`/`Animation<n>` materials), the morph manager (whose step only
  feeds a sum nothing reads; its UV offsets come from the field code per tick), the light flash
  (`CharacterLighting_updateFlash_006ab630`), the character fog's fade
  (`FogEffectManager_updateChrFogFade_006e3f40`), and the UI: the loading screen, the boot text,
  the debug text, the free camera.
- `BlurEffect_update_006c3d40`, the radial blur (`graphicActivateRadialBlur`), ignores the step and
  adds 0.098 to its time per call, ending past 10.0: 3.4 s at 30 fps, but 0.5 s at 200 fps. A
  high-frame-rate bug of the same path (`BlurEffectEx_update` counts calls too, but only its first
  frame matters).

`updateGlobalTime` and `PhyreScene_animate` run on every drawn frame, Repeats included. Nothing else
reads the step (the base `PApplication::animate` is `xor eax, eax; ret`).

**What the mod does** (`frames.speed.scene_time`, on). For each drawn frame the director computes
the game time it advanced (`SceneClock.Step`): the ticks it ran at the tick rate plus the change of
the accumulator's carry. Summed, that is the mod's clock, ticks + alpha: smooth between ticks
(at ×0.1 and 240 fps every frame moves 0.42 ms, no step at the ticks), the time scale and the
booster included, ×1 where the scale is held (voice-synced scenes, movies), and the world's speed
when the CPU drops ticks. Five hooks hand it on, only in the app frame whose `updateFFX` the mod
saw (`0x012fb8c4`, the application's frame count, ties them) and on the game thread:

| Hook | What it gets |
|---|---|
| `FFXApplication_updateGlobalTime_0042fa00` | The game's update runs with a probe step of 1, so the game still decides whether the time runs (pause, load, free camera). Then the mod writes its own `GlobalTime` (and the `+0x120` copy): the last value plus the frame's game time, kept in double precision (`GlobalTimeClock`). A value the mod did not write (a map change's 0) is taken over; 2400 still wraps to 0. As an f32 sum, past 2048 s one step of ×0.05 at 360 fps (0.14 ms) would round to a whole 0.24 ms |
| `TextureAnimation_Animate_00672000`, `CharacterLighting_updateFlash_006ab630`, `FogEffectManager_updateChrFogFade_006e3f40` | The game time as their step; 0 while `g_PauseOn` (the world stands still; `GlobalTime` already stops there) |
| `BlurEffect_update_006c3d40` | While it runs (`+0xc`), its time `+0x84` is set before the call so that the call's own +0.098 leaves it 0.098 × (game time × 30) on: 3.4 s of game time at any frame rate (34 s at ×0.1) |

The loading screen, the boot and debug text, the tips and the free camera keep the real step. With
the setting off, or the mod off, all five pass the game's step through.

**Other surfaces.** `GlobalTime` is one value for the whole scene, field maps and battle
backgrounds alike, so every material on a shader that scrolls by it (water, UV animation, ice,
wave) follows the same clock: lava, waterfalls or fog layers drawn with them included. Which map
uses which shader was not listed map by map; a surface that still runs in real time at ×0.1 is
on another path (report it). Surfaces animated by the field code (`yiAnimMain`, the morph manager's
UV offsets, the characters' texture animations in `Ch_CalcMiddle`) were already on ticks. Not
covered: the effects' own programs (held and replayed, "Effects between ticks"), the title's water
and the dream noise (their counters, above), FMOD and movies (real time).

### Open questions for the in-game test

- Whether a replayed effect looks like its tick (vertices, colour, draw order) and whether any
  effect still flickers or vanishes between ticks ("gone" in the window's Live section counts
  geometries destroyed since the tick).
- Whether interpolated bones look right on every model (skinned and not, the shadow instance
  `+0x838`). The bones were smooth in the 2026-11-07 test (×0.1); the hair was not (cloth, above).
- Whether the blended cloth sits on the body: hair roots, Tidus's shorts, Auron's coat, Wakka's
  crest, in slow motion and while turning. A cloth reset (a scene cut that keeps the character in
  place) is blended over one tick.
- The character warp thresholds in world units.
- Whether a Redraw frame looks like the tick frame before it: the field, message windows, battle UI.
- Whether a Repeat frame (no update) shows the last picture or a broken one, and whether the
  camera can move there (`graphicCameraSetWorldMatrix` alone, with the rest of the frame left).
- The cut thresholds in world units.
- How many ticks a second one core manages at ×100.
- The scene's clock: at ×0.1 the opening campfire's water and the sky's clouds (Besaid, Kilika's
  sea, the Moonflow) should crawl with the characters; at ×1 and 144+ fps they should move as at
  30 fps; paused, they stand. The radial blur into a battle should take as long at any frame rate.
